Malibu-Stacey,"As the other reply says USDT has first mover advantage as it's been around since 2014 and was effectively the engine behind the 2017 market peak.

USDT is also listed all over the place on every exchange that can't get regular banking (which is like, almost all of them) and most exchanges vastly overinflate their trading volumes so you should take all those numbers with several shipping containers full of salt. 
E.g. [Upwards of 70% of daily Buttcoin volume is wash trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/qwad0w/in_case_you_need_any_more_evidence_that_crypto_is/) conducted mostly using USDT &amp; until very recently, the daily reported volume of USDT was greater than the number in circulation (as in, each USDT was effectively being traded more than once per day, every day). When the number of USDT in circulation was lower, that ratio was higher (as in, each USDT was effectively being traded 3 or 4 times per day, every day).

As a counter-example, Apple has 16.4 billion shares issued in circulation. Around 80 million are traded every day which is one of the highest daily volumes on the NASDAQ. That's less than half a percent of all currently existing shares. That's what a regulated market looks like for one of the most valuable companies in the world. Compare that to the numbers the exchanges are pumping out with literally no verification at all, just a ""trust me bro, these numbers are legit there's no reason why we would just go on the internet and lie"".",1653863175

Ahaha, I‚Äôm playing around but seriously though‚Ä¶

This community is a mix between people who believe this sub is something like what you described, people who are the polar opposite of crypto shills (I‚Äôm going to call them anti-shills), and then there are some outliers scattered around. But you my friend, are an outlier here. 

The anti-shills are seemingly the most common and will act like they completely understand blockchains and every single crypto projects plan, model, and economics. Some really do have a good understanding of the technology and give genuine criticisms and feedback. But most are just parroting each other, and would like nothing more than to watch everyone in the crypto space lose their investments. 

They all typically will say something along the lines of it‚Äôs all a useless scam that‚Äôs been tried a million times, and is already being done a million times more efficiently with the current financial infrastructure. 

On top of, or quite possibly because of, that mentality there is the general consensus here that all crypto projects are ponzi or greater fools scams. God forbid you try to imply that logic would also translate to the current financial system, but I digress. 

All I‚Äôm really trying to get at here is if you have an opinion that goes against the general consensus then it will be very, very, very hard to have even a simple conversation with anyone on this sub. The anti-shills don‚Äôt represent everyone but in here they are either right or you‚Äôre too dumb to understand. 

The tribalism is just as bad as any other sub so, take this as your warning, and prepare for swarms of downvotes if you say something like conflicts with the majority sentiment. That said, I‚Äôm super happy to see your post is getting upvoted!

So what they did instead was to gut the entire blockchain division, and focused their efforts on the only profitable part ""hire a bunch of IBM consultants to add blockchain to your company"".

Don't put words in my mouth. [I read your sad article ](https://imgur.com/a/VnuwOVH) and as you can see the quote you gave is not on the article. Hence my question.

&gt;all you have is ""number go up"".

All you have is selective memory. You've already forgotten the tens of thousands of businesses that accept crypto as a form of payment, the lower class especially immigrants, using crypto to send money abroad and cutting out any and all transfer fees, wait times and exchange fees, entire business were made for this purpose. Like I said before I can explain something to you but I can't understand something for you, businesses, people, countries, governments, financial institutions are all using bitcoin and other crypto. So no, ""all I have"" is not number go up, you choose to believe this despite facts being given to you. Remember the unicorn? Believe in it or not it exists, it's not a unicorn. 

&gt;
yeah i see the ""attestations"" and the changing wording associated with how truthful they are. who cares. tether did the same shit.

OK... Believe what you want, usdc does have the [backing ](https://asterinvest.com/view/post/auditors-reveal-usdc-backing-as-jim-cramer-sounds-alarm-over-tethers-mad-money) even supported by [visa ](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.17821.html)

&gt;go tell r/terraluna about how great crypto is doing.

In 2017 thousands of coins crashed and never came back. Heck, months before tether inevitable death spiral videos and articles were already publicly available explaining how luna can and will fail just like every other algorithmic stable coin.

Fact is the crypto space now is still larger than it was a year ago or 2 years ago or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 years ago.

from paypal directly, as shown in the article you did not read.

&gt; I believe its going to fall even further and I believe its worth investing. Every bear/bull market cycle bitcoin crashes over 80 or 90% so 50% down from ATH is only halfway down. As I said, even with a 50% dip 3 years ago btc was 8000$ isn't the whole point of investing to look at the long term potential not the short term? 3 years isn't along time ago but if you had invested only just 3 years ago you'd still have more than 3x your money even despite a 50% dip. 

i once again ask why is bitcoin worth investing in. what is the value of bitcoin? what does it produce? what does it do? what service does it provide? what resource does it represent?

all you have is ""number go up"".

&gt; Usdc is regularly audited

yeah i see the ""attestations"" and the changing wording associated with how truthful they are. who cares. tether did the same shit.

tether and circle and every other shitcoin is the same thing. when new money slows down or people want to cash out, it all falls apart.

So, dollar cost averaging is just a simple, popular, and relatively effective strategy for any investor to use during a bear market to limit the potential downside and maximize the potential upside. 

A DCA strategy is not nearly as effective during bull runs, and very few people would even suggest doing this during one. 

That said, there are literally no serious investors or mathematicians that think it‚Äôs even a somewhat decent strategy to just throw money into a market regardless of the price action.

I‚Äôm not sure where you got any of your information from, but if you have any sources proving that ‚Äúyou are better off dumping it all in at once,‚Äù then I‚Äôd love to read them. Fair warning though, for every one article you find saying that‚Äôs true there are countless credible sources saying the exact opposite.

Sure you can look at charts and say ‚ÄúEverything goes up eventually so, time in the market is all the matters!‚Äù But that totally ignores the fact that if investing was as easy as ‚Äúput money into anything and hold,‚Äù then why isn‚Äôt everyone doing this? 

This is like a ‚Äústocks only go up,‚Äù mentality because everyone would know that their investment will for certain be worth more in the future. So, how would things even go down in value if it will always be worth more later and everyone buys regardless of price? 

I know this is conflicting with your statement so I don‚Äôt mean for this to be offensive at all, but I really hope this gives you at least a little insight on why your view isn‚Äôt really correct and why DCA is an effective strategy! 

Also, I think it‚Äôs always a good time to learn something new so I quickly found this article if you want to read a more concise breakdown (it goes into depth about the fundamentals, and pros and cons) of the DCA strategy.

And the people claiming there aren't ""central operators"" are full of shit. Let's see how bitcoin exists without the half dozen devs with github commits, aka blockstream, or the centralized mining pools, or the few exchanges running the entire show. 

Just because a single founder was anonymous, does not negate the fact that they may be rich as hell from the initial scheme, abandoned it, and passed the torch. That these secondary and tertiary operators are distributed doors not negate the fact that they are the new operators. 

And the fact that coiners latch onto a single ""unnecessary"" aspect of a ponzi is laughable. A ""central operator"" isn't even a necessary tenet of the definition. 

Look at all of the historical definitions of the word ponzi and tell me bitcoin doesn't fit the bill.

Energy is required for value. Energy consumption DOES NOT EQUAL pollution. Gold mining and the whole industry takes up similar amounts of energy during the initial process of mining, but the environmental impacts and energy costs down the chain are incomparable.

Check out this article it states it well. 
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-comparison-of-bitcoins-environmental-impact-with-that-of-gold-and-banking-2021-05-04?amp

 ‚ÄúAlthough the comparisons are not like-for-like, and with only Bitcoin‚Äôs scope of energy use and emissions being 100% defined, we can say that Bitcoin consumes/emits less than half of what the gold mining industry does, and less than one-fifth of what bank branches and ATMs do.‚Äù",1653337908

dotnon,"I agree that choice is good and that people should choose the trade-offs that are right for them. And you're right in that for large transactions, the per-transaction cost compares more favourably to a spread (we'll set aside the fact that if your transaction is of a certain size you'll be able to find a fixed price in the tradfi world as well). The real reason for my objection to blockchains, even absent the high energy cost, is that they are disingenuously being touted as a solution to anything that requires trust or verification in financial transactions. And the people doing the touting have much to gain by absorbing your money into their ecosystem.

I'm glad we agree on the awfulness of PoW, but there are still two big assumptions in your arguments in this thread:
- That there is a need for blockchains
- That Proof of Stake is a good governance model

On the first point, I think that's for r/Bitcoin or r/$myCrypto to show, as r/Buttcoin can never disprove it. We cannot argue that no solution exists, because one could emerge. But until it's here, there's no reason to promote cryptocurrencies or blockchains.

On the second, while it's of questionable value arguing it without settling the first, it is actually debatable. I am less opposed to PoS blockchains than PoW, because the negatives externalities only apply to participants. So long as they stay a niche toy in deep dark corners of the internet, I'll be happy to ignore them, but as long as I start see ads for negative-sum meme tokens on the tube, crypto companies naming stadiums, and traditional institutions investing in them, you can bet I'll be arguing against them on the internet!

In any case, as far as I'm aware, PoS is unproven at scale, and to me it seems intuitively problematic that consensus is decided by staking. I'm not an expert on proof of stake algorithms though, so I'd be interested to see what has been achieved using this model. But the very fact that Ethereum has repeatedly delayed their transition, and that PoW blockchains are winning in the market, tells me that it's either fundamentally flawed, or very very difficult.",1653321400

Please read my post in the thread above. That was meant to be a start of a discussion with AmericanScream. I even asked him up-front if he was really interested the discussion to now waste my (and his) time and energy with someone who just wants to push his agenda no matter what.

Feel free to reply there. I have shared a few examples which are already in use today. I would actually love to be involved in an open-minded discussion with some critics because I believe it can be fruitful for both parties.

But if someone tells me ""Yes, I am totally open to have my mind changed"" and ""please bring at least one argument"", and then after spending minimum an hour in writing a detailed post, I get ghosted and see the same guy just continuing with the same stuff as before....well, then that's a bit sad.

My invitation stands, if you are genuinely interested in having a conversation about it:

AmericanScream's whole argumentation is based on the assumption that there are no usecases of crypto where crypto is much better than a non-crypto solution. As soon as these usecases exists, blockchain has inherent value (similar to Silver, Oil, Electricity etc.) because we can use it to solve real-world problems better than we could without it.

In the above-mentioned thread I have given a few examples (there are many, many more). Pretending to be interested in a discussion, then just ghosting your discussion partner and continuing the same agenda without taking into consideration any new arguments is pretty much trolling in my opinion, even if this guy is admittedly very eloquent at it.",1653255260

Stop calling buying into a [ponzi scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/comments/o7v5xs/is_bitcoin_a_ponzi_scheme_a_detailed_analysis/), ""investing.""  It's gambling.  It's speculation.   I wouldn't call day trading, ""investing"" either.

&gt;If you invest in crypto, you are investing in the underlying protocols which are pervasive in modern financial and social networks.

Who told you that?  That's not true.  Modern financial networks derive nothing of value from crypto technology.

&gt;When you buy stocks you don't OWN anything...you own an ""IOU"" of an underlying asset. The DTCC custodies every share you buy. 

As a shareholder, I own a fraction of the company the share represents.  Whether the shares have a custodian or not, is a distraction.  I could say the same thing about crypto - your ""custodian"" is even more chaotic and unreliable than the DTCC - it requires an elaborate array of random computer operators wasting tremendous amounts of energy, just to exist, and there's no guarantee they won't turn off their computers and do something different next week.

If you own all the bonds in the world, you are very wealthy because everyone owes you principal and interest payments and you usually have a claim on their assets if they default.

If you own all the bitcoin in the world, you are very wealthy because‚Ä¶.. ???  I can‚Äôt think of a reason.""

Also to paraphrase the OP:

&gt; We just want people to stop lying and deceiving people of the risks with this incredibly speculative space.

I'd like to remind the sub, ad fucking nauseum (not specifically from me....but everyone, including me, who has evolved)

If you invest in crypto, you are investing in the underlying protocols which are pervasive in modern financial and social networks. The entire fabric of the underlying tech infrastructure is changing. Crypto is an entirely new asset class and it is going to continue to capture market cap....it is not going away!

With that being said, for those who continue to beat this lme ass drum of ""cRyPto iS nOthIng aNd hAs nO inTriNsIc vAluE....let's REMEMBER

When you buy stocks you don't OWN anything...you own an ""IOU"" of an underlying asset. The DTCC custodies every share you buy. 

Stocks, unless dividend stocks, only value is from people BUYING IN from the bottom and pushing the top out. And even in the case of dividend stocks, they can stop paying at anytime even if they're an aristocrat. 

The SEC allows you to gamble on the price action of stocks via options. People swing out of positions constantly without ever holding shares for and taking advantage of volatility and arbitrage opportunities. Many people do this off trend analysis alone and completely disregard earnings reports or valuations. While the underlying company may provide real world utility, the market makers are just playing an inherently ""worthless"" game. 

To compound the reckless and worthless layer of options built on top of the ""very useful real world value"" of corporations....you get another layer of ""intrinsically useless"" shit on TOP of options....derivatives and FX!!!!!

You know!!!??? The game where we get to bet on the outcome of the UNDERLYING OPTION RESULT!!! 

Guessing the outcome...on another guess of an outcome...with infinite leverage 

oh my how fucking incredibly useful and intrinsically VALUABLE!!! Not to mention incredibly honest...And most importantly....NOT AT ALL SPECULATIVE!!

Are you now saying that you believe this growth is over?  And that new investors to BTC today shouldn't expect the price to rise in the future? 

Or are you betting that BTC will continue to grow (100k by the end of the year, right?) and that it will probably never be a useful currency for lending or mortgages?

Plenty of great arguments on what is wrong with the current system, but nothing yet that has me convinced that crypto itself has merit as a form of value or currency.

_dongus_,"&gt;Bitcoin isn't a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud in which clients are promised a large profit at little to no risk. Companies that engage in a Ponzi scheme focus all of their energy into attracting new clients to make investments. This new income is used to pay original investors their returns, marked as a profit from a legitimate transaction. Ponzi schemes rely on a constant flow of new investments to continue to provide returns to older investors. When this flow runs out, the scheme falls apart.  
There is no person or company in charge of Bitcoin and nobody is promised anything. Bitcoin is just an open source protocol that is used to store and transfer value. It's a value transfer protocol.  
Large scale bitcoin mining is driving clean energy innovation.

heres more from them

&gt;I agree with you on the fact that governments have an obcious reason and interest to control and regulate the currency. This on the other hand might not be in the best interest for the ones paying the debt via inflation.  
&gt;  
&gt;For my understanding, what you wrote shows some strong believe in a kind of superficial power that ""the goverments"" have to decide on an evolving culture. As a senior student of law I might have some clue of how governments are legitimized to act as they do, but this shall not confused with the status of a god chosen king.  
&gt;  
&gt;As you mention bartering, which makes some good sense, we will likely have to find a currency to make it easier to exchange our efforts and keep or store that buying power for the future. This currency is (as history shows) most likely a kind of money with specific properties. It should be indestructable and therefore able to be stored for a long time, easy to handle, hard to duplucate or to add to the existing stock of the existing money supply, widley accepted which implies a necessary path (without force) to be accepted and destilled to be the money that serves these needs. So, in the past people decided that gold met these requirements and still do so. Only in the later history, it was decided to decouple currency (usd) from money (gold). But you guess what? Central banks around the globe (""governments"") are collecting more gold. What do you think is the reason for that? Is there anything in mind that might meet the above mentioned properties better than gold? Maybe with a decentraliced ledger that allows anyone to directly transfer ownership of the digital gold within seconds over the globe?",1653044563

MrDopple68,"Second post:

The other day I made a post about how imo I suspect Celsius are running a ponzi scheme with unsustainable business practices. Orginal post here:  
  
I also posted my concerns in the Celsius sub-reddit and have been banned.  
  
At the end of this post are links regarding what Celsius are doing and their shady past.  
  
Cory Klippsten who was one of the first to expose the Anchor/Lunna ponzi before it went south:  
  
https://youtu.be/cSRrKD04lv4  
  
Also has grave concerns about Celsius on his Twitter:  
  
https://twitter.com/coryklippsten/status/1525931922655891457  
  
I now have suspicions that three of the more respected Youtubers are shilling Celsius together.  
  
James from Investanswers.  
  
He is known to be a ""Not your keys, not your coins"" guy, and has made many videos regarding self custody.  
  
Yet numerous times he has allowed Alex, Celsius CEO on his channel to basically give him free advertising.  
  
This is odd. James says he doesn't leave his coin on exchanges and had gone as far as criticising Celsius's competitors Blockfi and Nexo.  
  
Today Alex shows up Digital Asset News. More ""free"" publicity.  
  
Once a week Rob who presents Digital Asset News and James get together to do a show together (with Ben Cowen).  
  
One more thing..I'm not sure if it's still there but Celsius web page had happy customer's faces in bubbles.  
  
One of those faces is of Dan's. I doubt Dan is allowing his image due to the goodness of his heart.

  
When Ben Cowen is not available (who I don't believe is involved) CT Larsson steps in to join James and Rob.

Guess who has Alex on his channel also? And guess who shilled Luna also?

If you look through their channels you will see it all matches up, including James's Luna to $80k video which got him banned from Youtube for a while.

https://youtu.be/Km7CW0Dm0zE

  
So: We have three YouTube influences who know each other, one of which (James) says he doesn't accept sponsors. All have links to Celsius. Alex is the only CEO of a cefi company James has had on his channel and he slags off the competition. James and CTO also shilled Luna.

KrazeeXXL,"&gt; PC gaming was particularly hurt by crypto (GPU price inflation + chip shortage) so it makes sense that these guys would be against it.

The last two years have been hell in this space. I'm building rigs since the mid 90s and there've been always ups and downs but nothing like this. As if Corona and the increased demand wasn't bad enough. Scammers and cryptobros really hurt PC gaming and building in general. We had this a couple of years before when GPUs got more powerful and relevant for mining. 

It's awful. There are some people who argue that you can just mine yourself to armotize the hightened cost of components. But yea no. I'm not going to become a part of the problem. 

This might work in countries with cheap energy. But I rather run a BOINC project again in this day and age than that egotistical, narcisisstic, turbo-capitalistic scam shit. I knew that higher energy costs would break the neck of miners here in my country at least. And it happened. Higher energy costs are terrible but pretty much the only thing I could see to stifle mining.

There were some funny attempts of cryptobros over at r/AMD. But gladly, they never got a foothold there. I argued once with such a guy and of course the ""you don't understand crypto""-card was played at the end. 

I just wish all crypto to burn for quite some time now. Glad that this sub here exists. It's been a great week so far. If not the best week for a long time!",1652655259

Walk_Run_Skip,"Your theory is good, but it's more than about the graphics cards. The reason I ended up on r/buttcoin is because of the full on assault the pro-NFT crowd made on gaming. 

I was crypto agnostic before, but after seeing Ubisoft and Square Enix commit to destroying their games in the name of corporate greed after the gaming space has already been warped constant subscriptions and loot boxes I ended up watching Dan Olson's The Line Goes Up video expecting I'd only watch a little bit to get a better sense of what NFTs were all about and ended up watching all two hours. 

The next day I sold all my crypto. I only had a little but after hearing Dan's argument I didn't want to touch any of it. If NFTs had kept themselves out of gaming I'd still probably be blissfully ignorant. (Also poorer, I sold right before Netflix plummeted and took the rest of the market down with it.

duskhat,"Damn, assuming that the writer didn't misrepresent her responses, she really had no idea how to respond. For instance:

&gt; Dan Olson‚Äôs critique: Cryptocurrency is a ‚ÄúGreater Fool‚Äù scam, in which members who buy in must convince someone else to invest in order to make their money back.

To which she responds with:

&gt; Tascha Che: It‚Äôs true that Bitcoin is disproportionately benefiting the earliest adopters.

Lol, the response has absolutely nothing to do with that specific critique. Dan Olson argues that there's no underlying value in cryptocurrencies, Tascha Che acknowledges that Bitcoin has a lopsided ""wealth"" distribution. What??

Another example:

&gt; Andrew R. Chow: You don‚Äôt find it ironic that this whole year through the NFT boom, people have been so excited about these assets on the blockchain that are still routed through a centralized server?

The point Chow brings up is that it's still centralized. Che responds with:

&gt; TC: A JPEG associated with an NFT is not any kind of technology breakthrough at all. [...] But what you‚Äôre owning is the hash token onchain, and that in itself has all the benefits that blockchain offers: It‚Äôs immutable, decentralized, hard to destroy.

&gt; So the way people have been associating these hash tokens with JPEGs, it‚Äôs not the greatest design. That‚Äôs for sure. I‚Äôm sure people will come up with something better, and they should.

So Che says ""yeah, using NFTs for images is silly,"" and does not address the centralism of it at all. Instead she just says ""nah trust me, it's totally immutable and decentralized,"" which is only a statement that contradicts the question without any justification.

She also caps off the interview with this horrific gem:

&gt; When Netflix, Amazon, Facebook first came out as really crappy products, a lot of incumbents didn‚Äôt pay much attention. But if it‚Äôs actually a revolutionary technology, which I believe Web 3 is, it‚Äôs not going to stay stupid forever.

GoodFoodForGoodMood,"Nah the way they're implemented it's not really ""resell when you're done with the game"", I think a couple of different terms are getting mixed up here.

Crypto bros have been promising that **NFTs** will revolutionise storefronts implementing a 2nd hand sales system. A stupid claim considering that does exist already in places: say in buying expensive licenses for professional software and VSTs, many of those can be resold 2nd hand and the license transferred. Not a bad idea, because those are things that - while a purchased version becomes outdated if newer versions need to be purchased fresh - can keep being used indefinitely, there's no ""end"" to them like a 10 hour game.

And there *is* the odd game community that (legitimately or illicitly) allows players to make money selling in-game items or in exchange for services (often making for a mosh pit of drama). And they sure as shit don't need a blockchain to do it.

Play to earn on the other hand are ""games"" (lol) that someone can buy into and grind at in exchange for payment. At least that's what's advertised lol. The way Axie implemented it, the ""gameplay"" is just about generating more of it's specific tie-in coin, which, same as any other crypto coin, fluctuates in price and can then be sold out for real money, provided there's liquidity.

But you need to purchase in-game equipment (3 axies in this case) to even get started which very quickly grew to a minimum buy-in of USD$500 just to be able to start playing, which kept growing, classic ponzi style, to over $1000 just to get started as a new player.

[This is a funny thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AxieInfinity/comments/m5rn9l/how_much_does_it_cost_to_start_playing_axie/), where at the time they said a $900 entry cost and that someone would break even in 3 months of playing daily. With classic fomo-inducing comments like:
&gt; if You're saying 1000usd is expensive then lets see if you can still say that in six months

The other option was to borrow from another player to earn in-game currency that pays them a cut of the earnings, which turned out to be less than minimum wage even for the players from the Philippines. Oh except for the few very top players, just like a good old-fashioned pyramid scheme.

[Get a load of people posting resumes and personal details in the comments](https://unbox.ph/editorials/axie-infinity-scholarship-the-complete-guide/), hoping someone gives them a ""scholarship"", ie letting them borrow axies.
&gt; How many hours per day can you dedicate to playing Axie: 8-12hrs


As you might expect, the gameplay looks like a shitty and unfun grind, I've never seen any of these people talk about it outside of the ""investment"" aspect. And despite the players **thinking that grinding away at the game was magically generating money**, the game's economy really just relied on a **constant intake of new players and money**, same as any crypto coin.

Anyway, I agree with you on the bloody ads everywhere, I remember in the 90s the adults around me were getting annoyed that ad breaks were getting more frequent and longer, and it slowly got worse as entertainment got cheaper and easier to access and produce. Crap F2P (pay to win) games are a stain for sure. And it's annoying as shit when other genres of mobile games are spammy with ads, but at least the small handful that people might find actually worth playing are near always happy to take a one-time fee of $2 to $10 to remove all ads, or are outright purchase only with no spammy free version.

I still buy games physically when I can, and outside of a handful of AAA's (the ones that sell a disc with nothing on it shit me to tears) isn't it mostly just indies that are usually digital only, due to not being able to afford a disc run? Unless you're talking about PC games, I have no idea how that sphere has been going.

I've also seen bear markets, coins crashing, nothing ever changing, rug pulls, scams, cexs stealing money, stablecoin ponzis and people losing everything.

1. Don't pretend you are any good at investing. Go to r/Bogleheads and read up on how to invest like a dummy. 3-Fund portfolios are your friend.
2. Invest the maximum funds you can take each year into your 401k (if it is offered). Open a Roth IRA if you don't have one, and invest the max amount each year (it should be $6000 in post-tax funds for you). Bonus points if your 401k has a Roth option.
3. Invest the maximum funds you can each year into your 401k (if it is offered). Open a Roth IRA if you don't have one, and invest the max amount each year (it should be $6000 in post-tax funds for you). Bonus points if your 401k has a Roth option.
4. Diversification is key. Don't make the mistakes that crypto bros make in thinking that putting money in different cryptos means you are diversified. Your money should be in entirely separate asset classes. So that means equities (stocks), bonds, short-term money (Treasuries, money market funds, cash), and eventually some real estate in the form of your house. What the exact composition of your asset mix is will depend on your age, expected expenses, income, and risk tolerance.
5. Always invest for the long term, preferably on the order of decades.

For me, these 5 rules look like a portfolio of 60% VTI, 40% VXUS for my equities, and a mix of cash and a ladder of I-bonds for my emergency fund and short-term expenses.",1652470514

In reality though, these are a few examples of publicly traded companies where people lost the entirety of their investments. We've been in a bull market for the last 15 years where numbers only go up. Wait until you see what happens in the next few years where companies like Netflix and Facebook, investments that have been seen as strong bulletproof investments by boomers, are forced to start doing something different very quickly or face the same fate as toys r us. 

Go look at Rivian automotive and please tell me a company valued at $24B that sells nothing should be worth half of general motors.

Companies DO fail ""all the time"" but they don't Garner as much attention because they are small and newer companies, but with investors all the same.

BPC3,"&gt; Tell me, why should I not invest in a legit cryptocurrency with some kind of utility? 

Because it doesn't exist. Every cryptocurrency currently exists as, _at best_, a speculative financial asset. At worst, the entire system is a bigger fool scam - the only way to get fiat (read: real, tangible, usable) money out of crypto is for someone else to put that money in. 

This is largely the case because distributed trustless blockchains, as a technology, suck. They're virtually impossible to scale up due to the sheer amount of needed redundant work - any blockchain that actually does useful things will either stay extremely small, or become so large, slow, and unwieldy that it's no longer fit for purpose. 

To add to all of that, this bigger fool scam uses about as much electricity as a small industrialized nation. If you give even the slightest shit about the earth's environment (you should, _you live there_) they're pretty much completely inexcusable and should be regulated out of existence.

BankTank_TheDoggies,"If he paid 2.8 million to buy those coins then his 2.8 million was spread out to those sellers right at the start.  If he paid some smaller amount, let‚Äôs say 5 thousand and then rode the price up to 2.8 million dollars, it‚Äôs more accurate to say he never had 2.8 million, it was fake numbers on a screen. Maybe if he had sold early he could have realized that money and that 2.8 million would have disappeared from the buyers. But only a few people can do that. That multi billion market cap is fake in that there aren‚Äôt enough buyers to purchase those billions from them so the coin is not actually worth that much. 

Let me put it another way. I have ten rocks in my room. I invite my friend Jeff over and ask him to buy one of my rocks for 10k. He might be in on it with me, indeed I might loan him the money so know real money ever changes hands. Then I announce my rock is worth 10k and go on twitter and r/rockbro and announce I have 90k worth of rocks in my room. But is it really worth 90k?  If there are 9 stooges out there who go, ‚Äúwhile, I didn‚Äôt realize rocks were worth so much. Everyone else have fun being poor‚Äù and buys my rocks, well then now I don‚Äôt have that money.

dandykaufman2,"&gt;The moment you accept the premise that one Terra is not actually worth one dollar and yet transact in it, you are gambling, putting your faith in the vagueness of a system that failed to counter the single most obvious thing that can happen in cryptocurrency (a market crash.)  
The reason that this is such an industry-wide scare is that it fundamentally challenges the belief system of cryptocurrency. Once you begin to consider that you shouldn‚Äôt believe something is worth a dollar because somebody told you it is, you have to start wondering why things like Cardano, or Solana, or Avalanche are worth anything - aren‚Äôt they just fuel? Dogecoin and Shiba Inu already proved that belief can catapult and then destroy the value of a token - but the prevailing belief was that this was just a little fun, a crowd-based market manipulation where some people made a lot of money, rather than stark proof that these markets remain fundamentally illogical.

+ open account in index fund. Index funds are companies that don't invest in one company. They instead invest in all companies that are listed in stock exchange. This means that they have small and stable profit. Main reason why to do this is to **show him how his whole ""trading"" was totally pointless and simply having account in fund is better**.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing sports fans. Crypto is unregulated and therefore is not an investment it is a gamble, a gamble with a bunch of unknown unregulated entities at the helm. It's like betting on turtle racing at the bar, except the bar limits your bets to keep it fun. 

I'm sorry that desperate people were tricked by users that posted what I said above. 

I am not sorry that a bunch of self-righteous assholes who couldn't pass an economics class at [Everest Community College](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJl0XuDKSjc) are losing their ass in an unregulated uninsured 'economy' after thinking they outsmarted all logical conclusions. Telling people to ""stay poor"" and be ""wage slaves"" when all that was done is people commenting truths and warnings. 

Have I bought and sold crypto? Yes. Did I learn from losses? Yes. Did I also make a few bucks? Yes. The important lesson was in the loss. It was blatantly obvious this was going to happen again. Anyone alive and aware in 2017-18 saw this coming. Don't worry though, there will be another cycle another meme stock. Maybe next time you'll take your 10%, 25% or 100% gains and remember how stupid it was to buy at the top last time. 

I do feel bad for the people that felt like they had no other options. That is a symptom of our society and economy. I however, don't feel bad for college educated people that just gambled away everything they had because they fell for internet memes.",1652306598

We recognize how destructive the power of ignorance can be.  People spread lies and misinformation about investing and finance the same way they do anti-vax propaganda, and this causes innocent people to suffer.

The real morale of the story is that people grossly underestimate their risk tolerance and are shit at picking investments.

It's actually funny to me that the vast majority of people that fail at picking investments today do so because they picked obvious scams. Like, you could almost understand someone that invested in $NFLX and lost it all, it is a comprehensible mistake. But you don't hear about people losing their life savings on $NFLX ...

Tether being a fraud and Bitcoin being legitimately a good idea are not mutually exclusive.

All things with value need to require energy to retrieve, because otherwise they would not have value. Bitcoin takes electricity which can be generated in completely green ways.

If consensus is that Bitcoin has value, it has value and that does not make it a Ponzi scheme. Gold as a store of value has value because people hold it. If we decided gold was shit one day, it wouldn‚Äôt hold value.

Gold mining also causes great environmental and societal damage, and guess what, it takes energy to mine.

From here, if the Fed holds course, there‚Äôs only one way Wood‚Äôs fund will continue to head - and it‚Äôs not up.

markb_elt,"This is spot on.

There are many similar posts on r/Bitcoin, but one in particular I'm thinking of from the last couple of days. The title is something like ""I finally got to .01 bitcoin."" In other words, here is someone who is scrapping and saving to invest $325 or something similar in bitcoin. Maybe it's a kid; maybe it's someone is paycheck to paycheck; maybe it's a retiree on a fixed income.  


Those are the people who are getting destroyed by all of this. But honestly, better to happen now while crypto is still relatively niche then to happen in 2-5 years. Because even if the price of bitcoin was going up, that person is going to lose all of their money. Why? Because they're investing $325 thinking that they're going to 100x their money. There is no understanding in the crypto world that investments are super risky and that getting 8% annually is a huge win. They all think that every dumb coin or NFT or whatever is going to exponentially explode. People literally think that Gamestop is going OVER a million dollars a share, and they shamed anyone who wanted to cash out their investment when they could have made 10x. There are literally going to be no winners among retail crypto investors, because either prices are going to collapse, or because people are going to be too greedy to sell when prices do go up in a more modest way. The sooner that idiocy ends, the better.

This is what's called a *strawman argument*.  You are arguing against a position I never made.  

Let's review what I said:

&gt;Just because some people can cash out, doesn't mean everybody can cash out.

I'm saying not everybody can cash out.  That's significantly different from ""nobody can cash out"" which is obviously absurd.  Some people will be able to cash out.

The Luna Foundation Guard effectively used their ENTIRE reserve to accomplish this. They had nearly $4B of reserves last week and now they have maybe $200M. They have liquidated this entire pool to prop up the value of UST. They did this FOR YOU, so you could get out.  
There is no money left to save this stablecoin again, and it will now begin a slow slide to zero as the peg is destroyed and the experiment fails.

This is a pretty shitty [false equivalence](http://bsalert.com/fallacies/false_equivalence.html).

Faith is the belief in something despite there being evidence it's worthy of belief.

There's plenty of evidence that the United States is going to stand behind the US Dollar. They've been doing so for all of our lifetimes, and in order for the dollar to collapse, the entire economy would have to collapse, which also means things like electricity, the Internet, cellular and stuff like *enforcement of private property rights* would also collapse.

What coiners are doing is assuming a priori that their system is better than what we have, while critics are pointing out the problems.

BTC can‚Äôt work as a currency, coiners shift the argument (‚Äúit‚Äôs not a currency, it‚Äôs a store of value!‚Äù).

It's a good trick to pretend we all view the broken pipes the same way (like this subreddit does), and you could apply this to any subjective opinion you have to try to make it appear objective.  But, the fact is we don't all view the broken pipes in the same way.  For me the pipes have been decaying for decades and bitcoin helps patch it up at least a little bit, assuming it's successful of course.

You also have to take me through the ""logic"" that gets you to where you are.  These are the questions that don't tend to get answered, the hows and whys:

**Why should it fail and what's your motivation for that?**

...and the most important question: **How will it fail?**

Opinions of it aside, how do you have something that has worked its way into almost every aspect of society, all the way up into the institutions and government level and think everyone is just going to change their minds out of the blue.  People who own it now are in political positions at this point, along with other rich people to lobby for it... and rich people love to protect their investments by lobbying the government.

Like if you asked me 5-10 or so years ago I'd be right there with you, I couldn't imagine it passing the thresholds it has... but here we are.  At this point you need a catalyst to stop it and I'm not having anyone fill in what that blank is, can you fill it in? The only thing I can think of is an unforeseen design flaw that can't be resolved, that's the only thing that can take it to zero in my mind....  and it just so happens that's a super cheap hedge to buy every year or two that can get 1:100 kind of returns.

At what point does a pyramid scheme just become reality when enough people are on board, there's gotta be some point for everyone eventually.  I mean is gold a pyramid scheme to you too? We apply a ton more extrinsic value to it than its intrinsic application value and I don't see a /r/buttgold.

AmericanScream,"&gt; I can tell you for a fact that they are, and that there's apparently a solution for the point of entry problem but that it's complicated. But that's all kind of irrelevant to the point at hand.

AmericanScream,"&gt; That's because the majority of your points there are only relevant for end-users.

No.  My points are relevant in any situation.  If you can cite an exception, cite one..

&gt;Businesses can use NFTs to track entities in a supply chain because there are few enough parties involved in that that no one of them can take a monopoly.

The NFT supply chain claim was already addressed and debunked in my [original analysis](https://reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/comments/lq6xpq/the_defacto_list_of_cryptocurrencyblockchain/)

Did you not read it?

Blockchain cannot be guaranteed to verify the integrity of anything OFF blockchain.  This creates what's called, ""The Oracle problem"" in that the data on blockchain is only as legit as whoever enters it onto the chain, and people can forge data regarding supply chain info, and then you have bad supply chain data on blockchain, and NFTs can't tell the difference.

I'm getting frustrated that you're using years old arguments that have already been abandoned.  Nobody is using NFTs to track supply chain data.  It doesn't offer any advantage over non-blockchain systems.  Anybody who is using blockchain in these instances, is just doing it as a PR move - not because it's in any way innovative.  The jury is already rendered its verdict on this.  If you think otherwise, explain to us in specific detail what blockchain can do that's clearly better than non-blockchain methods?  We can verify the integrity of data using cryptographic signatures without the wasteful, inefficient, blockchain system.

&gt;Industry players are adopting blockchain based NFTs.

There you go again.  Making an ambiguous claim without any specifics, therefore it's impossible to prove true or false.

If you insist on doing this, I put you in our special NFT-based BANLIST.  This is bad-faith arguing.",1651788778
Rozzz123,"This is a really interesting take on bitcoin and exactly what I was looking for when I made this post, unlike some of the other replies I have had so far.

I like the poker game analogy, however I think it applies far more to 'traders' than 'investors'

I also agree that it's untethered from reality but with the current state of the global markets I think you'll struggle to find something that isn't. Just look at Tesla, should it be the 6th largest company by market cap? I don't think so. Alot of people don't think so. Does the price go down? No. Will it one day? Maybe. Same thing with bitcoin. Of course there are differences, one is a company with growth potential and the other is a 'currency' but in the end both are completely disassociated with their intrinsic value.

Aside from that I'm glad to get a bit of an opposing opinion that isn't the endless echo chamber that is r/bitcoin
Whether or not it's a Ponzi, I guess we won't know until it collapses, or it doesn't.

Alot of people far smarter than me are strong supporters of crypto and alot are strongly against it, which of course doesn't help but hey ho maybe in ten years I'll say 'damn I should have put more in' or maybe I'll say 'what an idiot I was' but I'll have to wait ten years to find out the answer to that one.

People in this sub are sure they are right, people in r/bitcoin are sure they are right but sadly only one gets that honour. There's going to be plenty replies calling me stupid I'm sure but hey you can't please everyone.

I really do hope bitcoin does well and turns my measly ¬£100 into ¬£200 or maybe even ¬£300 but if it goes to zero no hard feelings and although I won't enjoy them, I'll accept the 'I told you so's coming my way.

free_allegory,"Anti-crypto guy here who decided to put a little bit of skin in the game so as to have a reason to pay attention to all the hype and fomo going around in Number-Go-Up-Land.

Staked (deposited and locked up) 350 Euro for their ruby red Visa prepaid card (2% cashback) approx. 1 year ago after the value had come down a bit from a previous high. Only money I ever put in any crypto. Number went down another 50% shortly after that, which was OK because the cashback is calculated in fiat but paid out in CRO. The loss on the stake was only virtual.

6 month minimum staking period ended, number slowly went up again to just below the price at which I had bought the stake. Unstaked and sold the former stake at a miniscule loss to avoid having to with the tax implications of selling at a profit. Also sold my cashback CROs, which netted me around 75 Euro. Number went absolutely to the moon right after that, would have considered dealing with tax stuff for the extra 1500 Euro. Oh well... After selling the stake and the cashback CROs I took care to always sell all accumulated cashback once it passed the minimum sell threshold (3,48 CRO).

Put the fiat from my sold CRO on the card and spent it the regular way. Once the money was spent, I started spending via a Curve MasterCard that had both an evil traditional bank VISA behind it and CDC's prepaid VISA. Curve card was set to charge to that evil low-energy weak nocoiner card issued by The Big Banks. Twice a month I would calculate my spend, transfer that exact amount to the Eurocent to my CDC fiat wallet via an instant SEPA transfer and put it on the CDC prepaid Visa. Then I would switch all the spending in the Curve app to CDC's virtuous Number-Go-Up card for the cashback. Real fiat money would be in my CDC account for literally just minutes. That's how much faith I had in these guys.

Once a month I would pad the transfer with an additional 400 Euro (the month free ATM withdrawal limit for the ruby red tier) and withdraw the from an ATM. I almost never use cash these days, it's just my way of showing my appreciation for their business.

The recent CRO meltdown has cost me exactly 0 Euro in real fiat money and 0,15 Euro in lost value on my CRO cashback savings.

akaean,"&gt;Now, there are upper limits of what you call ""substantial"", this is just a subreddit after all and the decisions aren't exactly world changing. But for instance users have voted and passed a number of proposals, such as (1) removing memes from the subreddit entirely, (2) limits to the number of posts in the top 50 that can be occupied by a specific coin, (3) removing of live posts, (4) sorting comments by new for the first few minutes after a post is live, and (5) setting a new special membership price.

Here is the thing though, none of what you described here actually breaks any new ground. None of these use cases of Moons realistically *needs* to be on the blockchain to function.  Subreddit moderators turning towards their communities to vote on issues happens *all the time*, Gwent doesn't have a crypto governance token, and here is the community voting on an issue (in this case [voting down the implementation of reddit powerups](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwent/comments/qg25zs/community_poll_reddit_powerups/)).

What do Moons add to the voting process that couldn't be achieved by just opening the floor to the community as a whole?   In all honestly, many people who use reddit primarily lurk, why should their voice in how they enjoy the platform be less heard than someone who takes enjoyment from posting or commenting?   Seriously though, in all of the votes you mentioned, what would realistically be the difference to just opening up a general poll on the subreddit and gaging the popularity of a measure from there. 

I would also ask you this, as a mod, is there anything actually *binding* on the votes to your actions as a mod?   So there was a vote to ban memes.  Great.   Now if the mod team decided that they weren't going to enforce that rule, do the Moon holders have any recourse?  Do the Moon holders have grounds to appeal to the Reddit Admin team?  Do the Moon holders have the ability to impeach or otherwise hold noncompliant mod teams accountable to their votes?   Because if they don't have any tools to enforce the outcome of their votes, and if their votes are at best ""suggestions"" that the mod team can follow at their whim... then there is even less of a real ownership interest.  

So we go back to core fundamental concepts of ownership here.   No matter how many ""moons"" someone has, they can't actually own a part of the cc subreddit, this is because the cc subreddit exists completely at Reddit's pleasure.   If Reddit goes underwater and shuts down its servers, any ""ownership"" from Moons means absolutely nothing.  If the Reddit decides to remove *all financial subreddits including cc...* ownership of those moons means absolutely nothing.  

So at the end of the day we have the following situation.

1) Reddit releases a poorly designed, superfluous, community blockchain voting concept 

2) CC as one of the premier crypto sub gets in on reddit's crypto project with moons.  

3) Because Reddit's crypto project sucks and violates core tenants of how crypto should work- such as freely transferable assets and digital ownership- CC attempts to hotwire the system to allow more ownership to users.

4) Because Crypto sucks as a governance tool, the CC crypto immediately gets abused by farmers who work their ass off to farm moons which amounts to less than $2,400 per year earned by the most prolific poster on the subreddit.  

5) Because CC still needs to appear to be complying with Reddit's dumb policies regarding their ill conceived crypto project, only ""earned"" Moons can be used for governance... not purchased Moons, causing their votes to internally fail and the system to break further.

6) Realizing their mistake, CC implements draconic policies to re limit the transferability of the coin.

So the end result is that we have a glorified community poll feature taking up space on the blockchain that doesn't confer any real ownership... and efforts to restore some aspects of ownership (like being freely transferable) actually caused the community to become *worse.*",1651514880

ominous_anenome,"I'm cognizant of what subreddit I'm in haha, but I think it's rather harsh and unfair to call Moons/RCPs, which are still in beta and haven't even officially launched yet, a failure. 

r/CryptoCurrency was the first subreddit (along with r/FortNiteBR) to test this feature for reddit. Naturally there are going to be some growing pains and things we learn along the way. 

I am of the personal opinion that some form of ownership through RCPs is a great idea (albeit one that needs some modifications). At a base level, having them for reputation and governance for community decisions are already features users enjoy quite a bit. They can also be used to buy a special membership (which unlocks some additional features) instead of paying in fiat currency, or to tip other users for their content.

Now, there are upper limits of what you call ""substantial"", this is just a subreddit after all and the decisions aren't exactly world changing. But for instance users have voted and passed a number of proposals, such as  (1) removing memes from the subreddit entirely, (2) limits to the number of posts in the top 50 that can be occupied by a specific coin, (3) removing of live posts, (4) sorting comments by new for the first few minutes after a post is live, and (5) setting a new special membership price. 

Distributing this voting power to others, rather than solely in the hands of moderators is a big move for how subreddits can be operated. And while of course there are going to be some things that can't be voted on (e.g. a poll saying to allow hate speech like in your example), I'd argue that in aggregate these are fairly large changes to the subreddit (especially (1) and (2)). They were supported by the community and subreddit looks very different than it did as a result.

The issue over selling Moons is undoubtedly a gray area. In the docs Reddit mentions use-cases outside of reddit for RCPs, which is why putting them on the blockchain is needed. This further gives users sense of ownership because once they are distributed, no authority can take these points away. The user earned them and they are there's. If you want to integrate these points offsite or otherwise display them, the blockchain allows you to do so.

The issue we ran into was in part due to the way in which Moons hold voting power. For context, you cannot have more votes than you've earned. For example, if you have earned 1,000 moons and buy 500 more, you'll still have 1,000 votes. This makes the system not pay-to-win. 

A small percentage (\~5%) of users, many of which spammed the subreddit like OP,  earned and sold moons, therefore causing \~38% of votes to be lost. This rendered governance to be gridlocked since polls even with high levels of support (\~80%+) wouldn't meet the threshold needed to pass. CCIP-030 was introduced as a  way to mitigate this issue. It's not a silver bullet and can be changed/removed if users vote so.

AmericanScream,"&gt; gold is consumable

No it isn't.  It can be recycled.  It's never consumed as far as I know, with the exception of really stupid restaurants that use gold leaf on hamburgers order to attract people with more money than sense.

&gt;Bitcoin can be counterfeited: false. try to pay someone with your fake bitcoin (whatever that means) and let me know. It doesn't matter if you are an exchange or satoshi nakamoto.

This statement is only true with a very specific, cherry-picked scenario.  You can't have it both ways.  You can't say ""bitcoin can't be counterfeited/hacked"" and then say L2 solutions (which can cause double spending issues) are part of bitcoin's future.  Also, there are a thousand ways people can steal bitcoin and the only way you claim it can't be hacked is if you just presuppose none of those things will happen (trojans, vulnerabilities in software, MitM attacks, corrupt exchanges, etc.)  So the ""security"" aspect of bitcoin is a fragile house of cards that only stands if it's encased in resin and viewed from a distance.

&gt;Gold is decentralized: this one is interesting never thought about it. It sounds true-ish for what concerns the ownership (assuming we ignore the futures argument, otherwise it's a no). However I would argue it is less decentralized than bitcoin.

Bitcoin isn't de-centralized in any meaningful way.  It still relies on centralized networks to operate, using resources run and managed by centralized entities (electricity, DNS, BGP, IANA, ISPs, Wifi/Cellular/radio, etc.)

Again, the claims made about bitcoin only hold up if you cherry-pick a certain level of ""de-centralization"" and ignore all the other centralized systems its dependent on.

This is what we run into in any examination of crypto -- lots of deception.

&gt;Bitcoin isn't smart/programmable: false, you say it yourself. The fact that it requires consensus doesn't mean it isn't programmable. quite a few nice features (multi-sig, time locks..) have been built into it. It's slow changing, but most people in the space consider it a feature, not a bug, since it reduces dramatically the chances for errors we see on other protocols.

Bitcoin 13 years into its development, is still about 50 years behind existing financial technology.  I wouldn't call that ""smart.""

A lot of your questions can be answered by reading reddits document on community points 

https://www.reddit.com/community-points/

Moons are part of Reddit‚Äôs ‚ÄúCommunity Points‚Äù efforts. They envision a system in which users earn some ‚Äúownership‚Äù of the subreddit by contributing to it. 

This ownership comes in the form of a cryptocurrency token that is used to vote on polls about how the subreddit is governed

Moons are the r/CryptoCurrency community points. It‚Äôs against Reddit terms of service to sell them, but it‚Äôs not like anything can be done to enforce that and as soon as people created exchanges to do so users learned that they could spam the subreddit and use it as their own personal sweatshop.

OP is one of the worst offenders here, spamming literally thousands of low quality comments per month just to earn moons and sell them.

akaean,"I suppose your point is that OP's hands aren't clean, but reading through his article and reading through your rebuttal it does leave me with some questions.

The most pressing one is ""why are moons?"" 

&gt;Moons reward posters, commenters, and moderators for their contributions to the subreddit. They are distributed monthly and used to weight your vote on polls.

What is the point of this?   What does this accomplish that just regular old reddit karma doesn't already provide, by and large?   

From my understanding, and you are absolutely free to correct me if I'm wrong, is that the entire point of making Moons a crypto *currency*, is to *financially incentivize* people to participate in the subreddit by giving them *ownership* of these governance tokens.  The lure is that users are then *free* to do whatever they want with the coins they have earned.

Step in if I'm wrong at any point, but from what I can tell, is that OP here was using Moons like you would expect.   Earning them by contributing to the subreddit (that he was a major poster doesn't mean he got them illicitly or in bad faith), then choosing to sell those coins to someone else on a marketplace that *you* designed.   

If we assume that the ""price"" of moons reflects the market value of ""governance"" on the cc subreddit, then we can say that OP earned governance in the subreddit as represented by his coins and then *chose* to sell that governance authority to someone who wanted it by selling his coins.

If anything CCIP-030 is an admission by the reddit cc team that crypto currency is a poor solution to governance.  

&gt;Users can still do whatever they want with their Moons. This proposal is meant to incentivize holding and using Moons for governance, and to deter users who only contribute to the subreddit in order to earn and sell Moons.  ([https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u3js8m/ccip\_030\_create\_karma\_multiplier\_based\_on\_moon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u3js8m/ccip_030_create_karma_multiplier_based_on_moon/)) 

Is this true though? You are in fact retroactively punishing people for selling governance tokens by hindering their ability to earn future.  How is this not an admission of failure? 

It would be like a corporation hiring you and saying, I'll pay you $100,000 per year in shares of this company, but if you *sell* more than 25% of those shares then your pay will be decreased to $10,000 in shares for all years going forwards, and not only that if you *ever* sold more than 25% of your shares in a year in the past, than your pay will be similarly decreased.   Are you ""free"" to do whatever I want with the shares you were paid?  Yes.  Are you ""free"" to find a new job?  Also yes.  But that doesn't change that the *reason you* went to find a new job was because of a scummy pay structure run by a scummy company.  Your ""freedom"" to find a new job or choose not to sell shares doesn't make the company any less shit.  And, because its retroactive you wouldn't even have been able to plan around it.  Say you actually thought that the company stock was a good investment, and thus you cashed out a modest $50K per year to make a decent living and saved the rest of your shares.  You would be smacked with this policy change same as everyone else because you didn't (and how could you have?) forseen the 25% retroactive policy.  

Its not ""free money"" if someone has to spend time and effort contributing and participating in a subreddit, farming moons, even if an incredibly *dumb* way to earn income is still an activity that requires work to do.  

Riddle me this, what is the point of a block chain governance token that allows you to monetize and sell your influence... if it so fundamentally fails at its core functionality that you have  to actively punish people who sold their influence (and being able to do such is *the entire point* of having something be a crypto currency in the first place) in the past to achieve a simulacrum of what the token is supposed to do?",1651500691

This includes 2,200+ comments last distribution and already 1,600+ comments in this distribution. **This is more than** [**double**](https://i.imgur.com/B9AxnKu.png) **the next highest user and even more than coinfeeds-bot**
2. You sell almost all your moons, indicating you didn't intend to use them for governance. You post/comment many times about loving moons (easily verified from camas reddit search). And why shouldn't you? It's basically ""free"" money earned from the sub
3. CCIP-030 passes with a lot of support (&gt;80% of moons, &gt;70% of votes).
4. Now all of a sudden you say you dislike moons and make a (now removed) [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u45y5w/moons_were_the_worst_thing_to_happen_to_this_sub/) titled ""Moons were the worst thing to happen to this sub; change my mind"". In it you say **""Now all this sub is moon-farming!!!"", despite being arguably the most prolific moon-farmer.**
5. **Even after CCIP-030 passed**, [you still sell \~6,000 Moons](https://i.imgur.com/p87iGSi.png) and are now complaining about having a low multiplier and it being retroactive?? And to be clear we are not banning users or anything for retroactively selling Moons. 
6. I'm not sure if you are just uninformed, or are trying to be intentionally misleading. But **I created ccmoons.com in August 2021. I became a moderator in February 2022**. So don't act like you thought this was an official site, almost all of your sells was during a time when I was just a normal user making a personal website for fun.

And based on your post's title ""...and fall of Reddit Moon Farming"", it seems like CCIP-030 is doing it's job! We don't want users who just spam \~2,000+ comments every month.",1651431092

AmericanScream,"&gt; I dont know what triggered you

I'm not the one who's triggered.  You're the one who needs a [safe space](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/p8uv0h/helpful_guide_for_butters_visiting_rbuttcoin_why/)

I like the way rather than address my refutation of your goofy claims you just act like you're being picked on.",1651425586
AmericanScream,"Bitcoin fees may be low right now but there's every indication this will not be the case in the future for multiple reasons:

* more more activity, the higher the fees - bitcoin has managed to not experience an explosion in fees, but this is because 99% of most crypto transactions are now done off-chain, at centralized exchanges - which ironically flies in the face of the so-called benefit of blockchain

* The price of crypto has to continually go up, or else the crypto [ponzi scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/comments/o7v5xs/is_bitcoin_a_ponzi_scheme_a_detailed_analysis/) implodes.  If crypto doesn't go up, then miners operate at a loss and will jack up fees

* As mining block rewards diminish over time, eventually the only incentive/payback miners will get for operating the blockchain will come from fees.  At that point, if crypto is still viable, fees will explode.",1651419100
jhb760,"So the trolls have just moved from r/cc to here I see. 

You just made a presumptive statement about someone you don't know based on their singular comment. At no point did they say they were an evangelist for BTC. You just assumed that. 

Unless someone makes a pretty clear stance, I would argue that presumption and comments that attack those preconceived notions are just as bad as someone on ANY subreddit that's trying to stir the shit-pot. 

There's lots of funny stuff on this sub and it actually helps balance out my own personal opinions. I'm sure it does the same for others. But this is my first time posting because this place is no different than the r/cc sub, and any opinions outside of the echo chamber will be shot down and berated. 

I get it, there's scams and a lot of unknowns that rely on baiting people into the dreams of high gains on a small investment in crypto. I'm not even going to argue that it's useful. *However* as an investor, it's hard to ignore an asset class that out performs the greenback in a ten year period. Some people are idiots, but some of us are adults that know we are in a casino and don't mind placing a long bet. 

However. If all you're going to do is make troll-like comments just like the losers that do it on r/cc then how are you any better?

End rant

TL;dr - The people shitting on others here are no better than the 'crypto bros' shitting on others on r/cc. I love that some people try to differentiate themselves here, but godamn if it doesn't sound like the same song played on a different instrument. Hate and trolls never change. Just their bridges.",1651418660

Siccors,"Nothing. Of course short term lots of drama, and on individual level there are people with huge problems. But society in general? Zero impact. Even if all crypto is removed. Just no more blockchains/DLT. What would the impact be? What would change in your daily life besides not visiting r/Buttcoin anymore? Which one of your appliances would stop working? Would your job change? 

Answer to everything there is: Nothing. Since crypto is completely seperated from the real economy. It has at this point in time virtually not a single real world application.",1651400262
